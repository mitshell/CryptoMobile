###     CryptoMobile toolkit      ###
#####################################

The toolkit implements python wrapper around 3G and LTE encryption and 
integrity protection algorithms.
This is delivered for study only:
Beware that cryptographic material, especially ciphering algorithms are 
always subjected to national regulation.
Moreover, use in real networks and equipments of some of the algorithms provided
are subect to royalties to be paid to the GSMA.


*** UMTS encryption and integrity-protection:

* UEA1 and UIA1 are the initial UMTS F8 and F9 functions for ciphering and
integrity protection. They are based on the Kasumi block cipher.
Specifications are public, but use is restricted: 
fees must be paid to GSMA, and Mitsubishi (patent holder for the initial 
Misty block-cipher)

* UEA2 and UIA2 are the secondary UMTS F8 and F9 functions for ciphering and
integrity protection. They are based on the SNOW3G stream cipher.
Specifications are public, but use is restricted: 
fees must be paid to GSMA (or ETSI ?), the patent holder of SNOW initial 
stream-cipher does not request any money :)

*** LTE encryption and integrity-protection:

* UEA1 and UIA1 are one of the initial LTE set of functions for ciphering and
integrity protection. They are based on the SNOW3G stream cipher.
Specifications are public, but use is restricted: 
fees must be paid to GSMA (or ETSI ?), the patent holder on SNOW initial 
stream-cipher does not request any money :)

* UEA2 and UIA2 are one of the initial LTE set of functions for ciphering and
integrity protection. They are based on the AES block cipher.
Specifications are public, but use is restricted: 
fees must be paid to GSMA, the patent holders on AES does not request any money :)
This library implements it through pyCrypto, which already contains AES
efficient code.

* UEA3 and UIA3 are a new LTE set of functions for ciphering and
integrity protection. They are based on the ZUC stream cipher.
Specifications are public, but use is restricted: 
fees must be paid to GSMA, the patent holder on ZUC may request money (TBC).

*** Milenage, base for 2G (USIM), 3G and LTE authentication:

* Milenage is the base algorithm for the AKA authentication developped within
the 3GPP standard. It is based on the AES block-cipher (making use of pyCrypto).
Milenage is also used in EAP-AKA and IMS-AKA protocols. Specifications are public
and use should not be restricted, AFAIK.


For all algorithms that have public specifications and that are not already
provided within pyCrypto, a source C code is taken from the reference C code
provided in the several 3GPP, ETSI, GSMA specifications.
All C codes can compile on Linux as .so or in Windows as .dll, a priori on both
32 and 64 bits systems. They may compile on other systems too.
They are not optimized in any way.

Python classes and methods are wrapping those native libraries thanks to the 
"ctypes" python library.

###     Installation      ###
#############################

1) Compiling C source codes to shared libraries:
only tested on x86 Little Endian architecture

*** on Windows system

* with cl compiler from MS visual studio
>cl /LD /O2 Kasumi.c
>cl /LD /O2 SNOW_3G.c
>cl /LD /O2 ZUC.c

* with tcc compiler from F. Bellard
>tcc -shared -o Kasumi.dll Kasumi.c
>tcc -shared -o SNOW_3G.dll SNOW_3G.c
>tcc -shared -o ZUC.dll ZUC.c

*** on Linux system

* with gcc compiler
$ gcc -c -O2 -fPIC Kasumi.c -o Kasumi.o && gcc -shared -o Kasumi.so Kasumi.o
$ gcc -c -O2 -fPIC SNOW_3G.c -o SNOW_3G.o && gcc -shared -o SNOW_3G.so SNOW_3G.o
$ gcc -c -O2 -fPIC ZUC.c -o ZUC.o && gcc -shared -o ZUC.so ZUC.o


2) Configuring the CryptoMobile/ directory to python path

*** on Windows system
copy the CryptoMobile/ directory containing the .dll and .py files to 
C:\Python2X\Lib\site-packages\

*** on Linux system
setup your environment variable PYTHONPATH to reference the directory where
you have the CryptoMobile/ directory containing the .so and .py file (this way,
you need to adjust some path in the CM.py file)
or 
copy the CryptoMobile/ directory containing the .so and .py files to 
/usr/local/lib/python2.X/site-packages/ (this way, you may have to adjust some 
path in the CM.py file, too...)

*** configure CM.py
configure the "library_path" global variable in the CM.py file, to reference
the path where the files are available, and the "library_suf" global variable
for the C library extension in use (.dll on Windows, .so on Linux).
